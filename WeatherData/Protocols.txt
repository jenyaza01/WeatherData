This program receives STRING-type data from serial port, every string in new line
String examples: 
ST0243H0541P7556B0807C1204S0440M0091L0012I0507E
SB0807P7556T0243C1204H0541E
ZP7556B0807E

S - marks start of data string, E marks end of string, if those missing, string marks an wrong or corrupted.
Z - marks start string of data, that can be updated faster than 10s (for example, brightness).

Every string contains data substring in format TNNNN. 
Lengtn of string equal 2(S,E) + 5*n, where n is integer number, count of substring, from 1 and up.
Strings with incorrect length will be ignored

Type of substring shows first char - letter of this substring (T), value is 4-digit (NNNN).
Substring examples:
H0245
I0290

Data substrings letters, types and parsing examples:

T - temperature				T1234 means 123.4°C
H - relative humidity		H1234 means 123.4% RH
P - atmospheric pressure	P1234 means 123.4 mmHG
B - brightness					B1234 means 1234 lux
C - air CO2 level				C1234 means 1234 ppm
S - dust sensor value		S1234 means 1234 standart units(?) of 0.2-1mkm particles
M - dust sensor value		M1234 means 1234 standart units(?) of 2-10mkm particles 
L - dust sensor value		L1234 means 1234 standart units(?) of 20-100mkm particles
I - ion level					----

Substrings with wrong letters will be ignored
Substrings may come in any order
String can contain more than one substring of same type, only the last value will be stored

Those letters still free to be used as substring type:
Q W E R Y U O A D F G J K Z X N
